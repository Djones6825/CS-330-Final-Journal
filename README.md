# CS-330-Final-Journal
This respository hold my final project from CS-330 and the README has my closing thoughts

I approach designing software by breaking down what I want to accomplish or add in small bite size steps. I haven't had the easiest time working on large project before this class because I would try to ingest and understand the project as a whole then try and change code. This class truley has shown me how important GOOD documentation is. I now leave more than a simple note saying what I changed. I now notate what the section I am working on does and make additional comments on what changes I made and how that changed the function of the code. I used to remove any old code that wasn't apart of the final design but I now comment out the previous working code so that I can reference it in the future if I need to.

This class has helped me advance my education and understanding of computer science by giving me new knowlege of the interplay between systems. I now have a greater understanding of how computers and IDE's work together to show me the most basic graphics that I have taken for granted. Now that I know how some of the calculations for the more basic systems work, it also gives me a greater appreciation of all of the math classes I have taken thus far. I can begin new projects with a better design and complexity by having a more diverse toolbelt to pull from.
